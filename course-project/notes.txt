The first step is to layout the structure. What components do we need??

Recipe Book : Feature

Shopping List : Feature


Root : Component
  -- Holding the overall app
Header : Component

Shopping List :features
  -- Shopping List : Component
  -- Shopping List Edit : Component
  ** Ingredient : Model

Recipe Book :features
  -- Recipe Component
    -- Recipe List :component
    -- Recipe Item :component
    -- Recipe Detail :component
    ** Recipe : Model (title, desc, so on)

Which model (data) should we use?
